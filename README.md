## What is "Parrot's Law" (called Oumu-no-hosoku in Japanese) ?
"Parrot's Law" is an English learning method. In short, it is an application of the training method that a parrot uses when learning words.

The parrot needs to remember the same words about 2000 times to learn human language at first. Parrotâ€™s law applies this repetition method to learning English.

Specifically, by reviewing short textbooks (e.g. the song lyrics) many times, you will be able to understand how to pronounce the words in the textbooks and understand the meaning of each word.
